This project is to track the badges on a randomize game of 3 pokemon games, all at the same time which are `Pokemon Fire Red`, `Crystal Dust` and `Emerald`.

> ℹ️ You can find how to play it here: [https://kittypboxx.github.io/GBAXG/](https://kittypboxx.github.io/GBAXG/)

## Why ?

You can play with friends and timebox your play session and as you win your gym badges mark them on the page (manually).

The reason for this is because the game does not track accurately all the badges across all 3 games.

## Features
